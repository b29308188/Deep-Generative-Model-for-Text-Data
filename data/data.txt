an american in paris is a jazzinfluenced symphonic poem by the american composer george_gershwin  written in 1928 
inspired by the time george_gershwin had spent in paris  it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s and is one of george_gershwin bestknown compositions 
george_gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the conductor walter_damrosch 
walter_damrosch scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta  saxophones  and automobile horns 
walter_damrosch brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition  which took place on december 13  1928  in carnegie hall  with walter_damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic 
george_gershwin completed the orchestration on november 18  less than four weeks before the work s premiere 
george_gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor  noting that   my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as george_gershwin strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere  
george_gershwin was attracted by maurice_ravel s unusual chords 
after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether maurice_ravel took students and how much maurice_ravel charged  maurice_ravel looked at george_gershwin s prior year earnings and sent a telegram to george_gershwin jokingly saying george_gershwin  maurice_ravel  should study with george_gershwin 
 but george_gershwin accepted george_gershwin as a student 
george_gershwin went to paris in 1926 ready to study and to enjoy george_gershwin first trip to paris 
after george_gershwin initial student audition with maurice_ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories  maurice_ravel said maurice_ravel could nt teach maurice_ravel but maurice_ravel would send a letter referring maurice_ravel to nadia_boulanger 
while the studies were cut short  that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a  thank you note  to george_gershwin s hosts  robert and mabel shirmer 
george_gershwin called it  a rapsodic ballet  written so freely and much more modern than george_gershwin prior works 
george_gershwin strongly encouraged maurice_ravel to come to the united states for a tour  something maurice_ravel had been reluctant to do 
to this end  upon maurice_ravel return to new york  george_gershwin joined the efforts of maurice_ravel s friend robert schmitz 
a pianist maurice_ravel had met during the war to urge maurice_ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting francoamerican musical relations and was able to offer maurice_ravel a  12000 fee for the tour 
an enticement george_gershwin knew would be important to maurice_ravel 
george_gershwin greeted maurice_ravel in new york in february 1928 at the start of maurice_ravel s us tour  and joined maurice_ravel again later in the tour in los angeles 
after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills  maurice_ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled  house concert  in a friend s music salon  performing among kindred spirits 
maurice_ravel s tour reignited george_gershwin s desire to return to paris which george_gershwin did in march 1928 
maurice_ravel s high praise of george_gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia_boulanger caused george_gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris 
yet after playing for her  she told george_gershwin she could not teach george_gershwin 
nadia_boulanger gave george_gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students  do nt copy others  be yourself  
in this case  why try to be a second rate maurice_ravel when you are already a first rate george_gershwin  
this did not set george_gershwin back  as george_gershwin real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow george_gershwin rhapsody in blue 
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers  among them ezra_pound  w b yeats  ernest_hemingway  and artist pablo_picasso 
george_gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called  very parisienne   written in 1926 on george_gershwin first visit to paris as a gift to george_gershwin hosts  robert and mabel schirmer 
george_gershwin described the piece as a  rhapsodic ballet  because it was written freely and is more modern than george_gershwin previous works 
george_gershwin explained in musical america   my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as george_gershwin strolls about the city  listens to the various street noises  and absorbs the french atmosphere  
george_gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main  walking  themes in the  allegretto grazioso  and develops a third theme in the  subito con brio  
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude_debussy and les six 
in the b section  george_gershwin uses common time  syncopated rhythms  and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet  saxophone  and snare drum 
after recapitulating the  walking  themes  george_gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final  grandioso  
although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a  b  c and d  it has recently come to light that george_gershwin s intention was to have used the notes a4  b4  d5  and a4 
it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a  b  c and d with circles  george_gershwin may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played 
george_gershwin did not particularly like walter_damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris 
walter_damrosch stated that walter_damrosch s sluggish  dragging tempo caused walter_damrosch to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work 
critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than walter_damrosch lukewarm concerto in f 
some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers csar_franck  richard_wagner  or guillaume lekeu on its premiere 
george_gershwin responded to the critics   it s not a beethoven symphony  you know  it s a humorous piece  nothing solemn about it 
the george_gershwin family  working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan  are working to make scores available to the public that represent george_gershwin s true intent 
it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material george_gershwin later deleted from the work  such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section   or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during george_gershwin s composition process 
conductor walter_damrosch walter_damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance 
the first recording was made for rca victor in 1929 with nathaniel_shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra  drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra 
george_gershwin was on hand to  supervise  the recording  however  nathaniel_shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the nathaniel_shilkret to leave the recording studio 
then  a little later  nathaniel_shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section  so nathaniel_shilkret hastily asked george_gershwin if george_gershwin might play the solo  george_gershwin said george_gershwin could and so george_gershwin briefly participated in the actual recording 
this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that george_gershwin had intended using the notes a flat  b flat  a higher c and a lower d 
the radio broadcast of the september 8  1937 hollywood bowl george_gershwin george_gershwin memorial concert  in which an american in paris  also conducted by nathaniel_shilkret  was second on the program  was recorded and was released in 1998 in a twocd set 
arthur_fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor  including one of the first stereo recordings of the music 
in 1945  arturo_toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall  one of the few commercial recordings arturo_toscanini made of music by an american composer 
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of george_gershwin s original score  before george_gershwin made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today 
harry_james released a version of the blues section on harry_james 1953 album one night stand  recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago  columbia gl 522 and cl_singer 522  
in 1951  mgm released the musical film an american in paris  featuring gene_kelly and leslie_caron 
winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards  the film was directed by vincente_minnelli  featured many tunes of george_gershwin  and concluded with an extensive  elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem  arranged for the film by johnny_green   costing  500000

the 88th academy awards ceremony was held at the dolby theatre on february 28  2016 and hosted by chris_rock 
the first best actor awarded was emil_jannings  for emil_jannings performances in the last command and the way of all flesh 
emil_jannings had to return to europe before the ceremony  so the academy agreed to give emil_jannings the prize earlier  this made emil_jannings the first academy award winner in history 
at that time  the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period  for example  emil_jannings received the award for two movies in which emil_jannings starred during that period  and janet_gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films 
the model for the statuette is said to be mexican actor emilio_fernndez 
sculptor george stanley  who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl  sculpted cedric_gibbons  design 
in 2016 the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes  handing manufacturing duties to chris_rock tavern  new york based polich tallix fine art foundry 
one biography of bette_davis  who was a president of the academy  claims that bette_davis named the oscar after bette_davis first husband  band leader harmon oscar nelson 
another claimed origin is that the academy s executive secretary  margaret_herrick  first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette s reminding margaret_herrick of margaret_herrick  uncle oscar   a nickname for margaret_herrick cousin oscar pierce  
columnist sidney skolsky was present during margaret_herrick s naming and seized the name in his byline   employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette  oscar   
walt_disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for walt_disney oscar as early as 1932 
in december 2011  orson_welles  1941 oscar for citizen kane  best original screenplay  was put up for auction  after orson_welles heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that orson_welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy 
in 1992  harold_russell needed money for harold_russell wife s medical expenses 
in a controversial decision  harold_russell consigned harold_russell 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to herman darvick autograph auctions  and on august 6  1992  in new york city  the oscar sold to a private collector for  60500 
harold_russell defended harold_russell action  saying   i do nt know why anybody would be critical 
harold_russell is the only academy award winning actor to ever sell an oscar 
mike_todd grandson tried to sell mike_todd s oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989  but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction 
originally scheduled for april 8  1968  the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days  because of the assassination of martin_luther_king_jr 
on march 30  1981  the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day  after the shooting of president ronald_reagan and others in washington  dc 
this  according to organizer bill mechanic  was to ensure the elimination of what ronald_reagan termed  the single most hated thing on the show   overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion 
william_friedkin  an academy awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony  expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009  describing it as  the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself  
the first to do so was dudley_nichols  best writing in 1935 for the informer  
dudley_nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers  guild 
george_c_scott became the second person to refuse george_c_scott award  best actor in 1970 for patton  at the 43rd academy awards ceremony 
george_c_scott described it as a  meat parade   saying  i do nt want any part of it  
the third was marlon_brando  who refused marlon_brando award  best actor for 1972 s the godfather   citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of native americans 
at the 45th academy awards ceremony  marlon_brando sent sacheen_littlefeather to read a 15page speech detailing his criticisms 
celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith_hoag  carolyn_hennesy  kate_linder  chris_mulkey  jim_oheir  and nba player john_salley 
ayn_rand   born alisa zinov  yevna rosenbaum    march 6  1982  was a russianborn american novelist  philosopher  playwright  and screenwriter 
ayn_rand is known for ayn_rand two bestselling novels  the fountainhead and atlas shrugged  and for developing a philosophical system ayn_rand called objectivism 
educated in russia  ayn_rand moved to the united states in 1926 
ayn_rand had a play produced on broadway in 1935  1936 
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in america  ayn_rand achieved fame with ayn_rand 1943 novel  the fountainhead 
in 1957  ayn_rand published ayn_rand bestknown work  the novel atlas shrugged 
afterward  ayn_rand turned to nonfiction to promote ayn_rand philosophy  publishing ayn_rand own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until ayn_rand death in 1982 
ayn_rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge  and rejected faith and religion 
ayn_rand supported rational and ethical egoism  and rejected altruism 
in politics  ayn_rand condemned the initiation of force as immoral  and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism  and instead supported laissezfaire capitalism  which ayn_rand defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights 
in art  ayn_rand promoted romantic realism 
ayn_rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to ayn_rand  except for aristotle and some aristotelians  and classical liberals 
literary critics received ayn_rand s fiction with mixed reviews  and academia generally ignored or rejected ayn_rand philosophy  though academic interest has increased in recent decades 
the objectivist movement attempts to spread ayn_rand ideas  both to the public and in academic settings 
ayn_rand has been a significant influence among libertarians and american conservatives 
ayn_rand was born alisa zinov  yevna rosenbaum   on february 2  1905  to a russian jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg 
ayn_rand was the eldest of the three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum and his wife  anna borisovna  ne kaplan   largely nonobservant jews 
with a passion for the liberal arts  ayn_rand later said ayn_rand found school unchallenging and ayn_rand began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten 
at the prestigious stoiunina gymnasium  ayn_rand closest friend was vladimir_nabokov s younger sister  olga 
the two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the vladimir_nabokov mansion  while nabokova defended constitutional monarchy  ayn_rand supported republican ideals 
ayn_rand was twelve at the time of the february revolution of 1917  during which ayn_rand favored alexander_kerensky over tsar nicholas_ii_of_russia 
the subsequent october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir_lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed 
ayn_rand father s business was confiscated and the family displaced 
ayn_rand later recalled that  while in high school  ayn_rand determined that ayn_rand was an atheist and that ayn_rand valued reason above any other human virtue 
after graduating from high school in the crimea at 16  ayn_rand returned with ayn_rand family to petrograd  as saint petersburg was renamed at that time   where they faced desperate conditions  on occasion nearly starving 
after the russian revolution  universities were opened to women  allowing ayn_rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university  where  at the age of 16  ayn_rand began ayn_rand studies in the department of social pedagogy  majoring in history 
at the university ayn_rand was introduced to the writings of aristotle and plato  who would be ayn_rand greatest influence and counterinfluence  respectively 
a third figure whose philosophical works ayn_rand studied heavily was friedrich_nietzsche 
able to read french  german and russian  ayn_rand also discovered the writers fyodor_dostoyevsky  victor_hugo  edmond_rostand  and friedrich_nietzsche schiller  who became ayn_rand perennial favorites 
along with many other  bourgeois  students  ayn_rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating 
however  after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists  many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate  which ayn_rand did in october 1924 
ayn_rand subsequently studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad 
for one of ayn_rand assignments  ayn_rand wrote an essay about the polish actress pola_negri  which became pola_negri first published work 
by this time pola_negri had decided pola_negri professional surname for writing would be ayn_rand  possibly as a cyrillic contraction of ayn_rand birth surname  and ayn_rand adopted the first name ayn  either from a finnish name aino or from the hebrew word  ayin  meaning  eye   
in the autumn of 1925  ayn_rand was granted a visa to visit american relatives 
ayn_rand departed on january 17  1926 
when ayn_rand arrived in new york city on february 19  1926  ayn_rand was so impressed with the skyline of manhattan that ayn_rand cried what ayn_rand later called  tears of splendor  
intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter  ayn_rand lived for a few months with relatives in chicago  one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed ayn_rand to watch dozens of films for free 
ayn_rand then set out for hollywood  california 
initially  ayn_rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay ayn_rand basic living expenses 
a chance meeting with famed director cecil_b_demille led to a job as an extra in cecil_b_demille film the king of kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter 
while working on the king of kings  ayn_rand met an aspiring young actor  frank_oconnor  the two were married on april 15  1929 
ayn_rand became a permanent us resident in july 1929  and became an american citizen on march 3  1931 
taking various jobs during the 1930s to support ayn_rand writing  ayn_rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at rko studios 
ayn_rand made several attempts to bring ayn_rand parents and sisters to the united states  but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate 
ayn_rand s first literary success came with the sale of ayn_rand screenplay red pawn to universal studios in 1932  although it was never produced 
ayn_rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result 
ideal is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by ayn_rand estate 
ayn_rand s first published novel  the semiautobiographical we the living  was published in 1936 
in a 1959 foreword to the novel  ayn_rand stated that we the living  is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write 
after the success of ayn_rand later novels  ayn_rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies 
in 1942  without ayn_rand s knowledge or permission  the novel was made into a pair of italian films  noi vivi and addio  kira 
rediscovered in the 1960s  these films were reedited into a new version which was approved by ayn_rand and rereleased as we the living in 1986 
ayn_rand novella anthem was written during a break from the writing of ayn_rand next major novel  the fountainhead 
it was published in england in 1938  but ayn_rand initially could not find an american publisher 
as with we the living  ayn_rand s later success allowed ayn_rand to get a revised version published in 1946  which has sold more than 35 million copies 
during the 1940s  ayn_rand became politically active 
both ayn_rand and ayn_rand husband worked fulltime in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of republican wendell_willkie 
this work led to ayn_rand s first public speaking experiences  including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had just viewed prowillkie newsreels  an experience ayn_rand greatly enjoyed 
this activity also brought ayn_rand into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism 
ayn_rand became friends with journalist henry_hazlitt and henry_hazlitt wife  and henry_hazlitt introduced ayn_rand to the austrian school economist ludwig_von_mises 
despite ayn_rand philosophical differences with them  ayn_rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout ayn_rand career  and both of them expressed admiration for ayn_rand 
once ludwig_von_mises referred to ayn_rand as  the most courageous man in america   a compliment that particularly pleased ayn_rand because he said  man  instead of  woman  
ayn_rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer isabel_paterson 
ayn_rand questioned the wellinformed isabel_paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave isabel_paterson ideas for isabel_paterson only nonfiction book  the god of the machine 
ayn_rand s first major success as a writer came with the fountainhead in 1943  a romantic and philosophical novel that ayn_rand wrote over a period of seven years 
the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what ayn_rand described as  secondhanders   those who attempt to live through others  placing others above themselves 
while completing the novel  ayn_rand was prescribed benzedrine  a brand of amphetamine  to fight fatigue 
the drug helped ayn_rand to work long hours to meet ayn_rand deadline for delivering the finished novel  but when the book was done  ayn_rand was so exhausted that ayn_rand doctor ordered two weeks  rest 
ayn_rand use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of ayn_rand later associates described as volatile mood swings 
the fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success  bringing ayn_rand fame and financial security 
in 1943  ayn_rand sold the rights for a film version to warner bros  and ayn_rand returned to hollywood to write the screenplay 
finishing ayn_rand work on that screenplay  ayn_rand was hired by producer hal_b_wallis as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor 
ayn_rand work for hal_b_wallis included the screenplays for the oscarnominated love letters and you came along 
this role gave ayn_rand time to work on other projects  including a planned nonfiction treatment of ayn_rand philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism 
ayn_rand extended ayn_rand involvement with freemarket and anticommunist activism while working in hollywood 
ayn_rand became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals  a hollywood anticommunist group  and wrote articles on the group s behalf 
ayn_rand also joined the anticommunist american writers association 
a visit by isabel_paterson to meet with ayn_rand s california associates led to a final falling out between the two when isabel_paterson made comments to valued political allies  which ayn_rand considered rude 
in 1947  during the second red scare  ayn_rand testified as a  friendly witness  before the united states house unamerican activities committee 
ayn_rand testimony described the disparity between ayn_rand personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film song of russia 
ayn_rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union  portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was 
ayn_rand wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what ayn_rand interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world  but ayn_rand was not allowed to testify about it 
when asked after the hearings about ayn_rand feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations  ayn_rand described the process as  futile  
although it used ayn_rand s screenplay with minimal alterations  ayn_rand  disliked the movie from beginning to end   complaining about its editing  acting  and other elements 
in the years following the publication of the fountainhead  ayn_rand received numerous letters from readers  some of whom the book profoundly influenced 
in 1951 ayn_rand moved from los angeles to new york city  where ayn_rand gathered a group of these admirers around ayn_rand 
this group  jokingly designated  the collective   included future federal reserve chairman alan_greenspan  a young psychology student named nathaniel_branden  later nathaniel_branden  and nathaniel_branden wife barbara_branden  and barbara_branden s cousin leonard_peikoff 
at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with ayn_rand on weekends at ayn_rand apartment to discuss philosophy 
later ayn_rand began allowing them to read the drafts of ayn_rand new novel  atlas shrugged  as the manuscript pages were written 
in 1954 ayn_rand s close relationship with the younger nathaniel_branden turned into a romantic affair  with the consent of their spouses 
atlas shrugged  published in 1957  was considered ayn_rand s magnum opus 
ayn_rand described the theme of the novel as  the role of the mind in man s existence  and  as a corollary  the demonstration of a new moral philosophy  the morality of rational selfinterest  
it advocates the core tenets of ayn_rand s philosophy of objectivism and expresses ayn_rand concept of human achievement 
with this fictional strike  ayn_rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive  the economy would collapse and society would fall apart 
the novel includes elements of romance  mystery  and science fiction  and it contains ayn_rand s most extensive statement of objectivism in any of ayn_rand works of fiction  a lengthy monologue delivered by galt 
in an interview with mike_wallace  ayn_rand declared ayn_rand  the most creative thinker alive  
after completing the novel  ayn_rand fell into a severe depression 
atlas shrugged was ayn_rand s last completed work of fiction  a turning point in ayn_rand life  it marked the end of ayn_rand s career as a novelist and the beginning of ayn_rand role as a popular philosopher 
in 1958 nathaniel_branden established nathaniel_branden nathaniel_branden lectures  later incorporated as the nathaniel_branden nathaniel_branden institute  nbi   to promote ayn_rand s philosophy 
collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that ayn_rand edited

ayn_rand considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics  epistemology  ethics  political philosophy and aesthetics 
in metaphysics  ayn_rand supported philosophical realism  and opposed anything ayn_rand regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism  including all forms of religion 
in epistemology  ayn_rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception  the validity of which ayn_rand considered axiomatic  and reason  which ayn_rand described as  the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses  
ayn_rand rejected all claims of nonperceptual or a priori knowledge  including   instinct    intuition    revelation   or any form of  just knowing 
ayn_rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization  which ayn_rand summarized in the form of a philosophical razor 
known as  ayn_rand s razor   it states that  concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity  the corollary of which is  nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity  
in ayn_rand introduction to objectivist epistemology  ayn_rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic  synthetic dichotomy 
in ethics  ayn_rand argued for rational and ethical egoism  rational selfinterest   as the guiding moral principle

ayn_rand referred to egoism as  the virtue of selfishness  in ayn_rand book of that title  in which ayn_rand presented ayn_rand solution to the isought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of  man s survival qua man

ayn_rand rejected anarchism as a nave theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice

according to ayn_rand  art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped  thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness

however  ayn_rand also found early inspiration in friedrich_nietzsche  and scholars have found indications of friedrich_nietzsche influence in early notes from ayn_rand s journals  in passages from the first edition of we the living  which ayn_rand later revised   and in ayn_rand overall writing style 
however  by the time ayn_rand wrote the fountainhead  ayn_rand had turned against friedrich_nietzsche s ideas  and the extent of friedrich_nietzsche influence on ayn_rand even during ayn_rand early years is disputed 
among the philosophers ayn_rand held in particular disdain was immanuel_kant  whom ayn_rand referred to as a  monster   although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that ayn_rand misinterpreted immanuel_kant and exaggerated their differences 
ayn_rand said ayn_rand most important contributions to philosophy were ayn_rand  theory of concepts  ethics  and discovery in politics that evil  the violation of rights  consists of the initiation of force
